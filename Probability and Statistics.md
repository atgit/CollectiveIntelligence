# Problem Domain
  - Analysis about the quantity relationship, not causality

# Classical Probability
  - Repeatable and one-time

# Equaly likely events

# Mutually exclusive events

# Independent events - the outcome of one event does not affect another event

# P(AB) = P(A) * P(B)

# Random Variable
  - Discrete - finite number of values
  - Continuous

# Distribution
  - Binomial distribution

# Expected Value

# Probability Density Function

# The Law of Large Numbers


# Statistics - Descriptive, Inferential

# Central Tendency
  - Mean
  - Median (reduce the effect of the noise of outlier)
  - Mode

# Measure of Dispersion
  - 


# Terms
  - Trial
  - Sample space
  - Permutation - P(n, r) and Combination - C(n, r)
    - C(n, r) * P(r, r) = P(n, r)
  - Frequentist philosophy
