- Code - systematic way to represent information
- Redundancy
  - Advantages: deal with noise; error correction
  - Compression
  - Error detection and correction
- Probability
  - n->âˆž, occurrence of event/n converges to P  (n = times of trials)
  - Features
    - Exhaustive
    - Mutually exclusive
  - Prior probability
  - event - all the possible outcome
