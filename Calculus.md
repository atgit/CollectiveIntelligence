# Calculus?
  - Calculus relates F(1) to F(2) pair
  - Focus on instant things
  - Differential and integral calculus

# First Derivative
  - Max and min - y'=0
  - Local max and min
  - y = f(x) ===> y' = f(x +dx)/dx, dx->0

# Second Derivative
  - Bending - convex vs concave
  - Inflection point - y"=0 - where bending changes
  
# Exponential Function
  - Exponential series

# Integral
  - reverse process of derivative

# Derivative of Product - product rule
  - p(x) = f(x)*g(x) p'(x) = f(x)*g'(x) + g(x)*f'(x)
# Quotient Rule

# Chain Rule
  z = f(g(x)) ===> z' = dz/dy * dy/dx

# Limit and Continuous Function
  Continuous means f(x) at x f(x)->f(a) as x->a

# Forward Function and Inverse Function
  - Symetric based on y=x
  - ln(y^n) = nln(y)
  - y=ln(x) y'=1/x
  - y=lnx y'=1/x=x^-1

# Growth of Functions
  - cx < x^n < n^x < x! < x^x

# Linear Approximation/Newtons's method
  - f(x) ≈ 	
  - Use the slope/derivative to approximate

# Power Series/Euler's Great Formula
  - e^ix = cos(x) + isin(x)

# Differential Equations of Motion

# Terminology
  - y' - y prime
  - y" - y double prime
  - Limitting process
  - Differential equation
  - n! - n factorial
  - growing exponentially
  - infinite series
  - compond
  - radian, e.g. 2π
  - least squares
  - grow polynomially rather than exponentially
  - centered difference: (f(x+dx) - f(x-dx)) / 2*dx 
  - real number vs imaginary number (i^2=-1)
  - absolute value of x - |x|
  - geometric series - 1 + x + x^2 + ...
