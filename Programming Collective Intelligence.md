# Intro
  - Use machine learning and statistical methods to interpret data
  - Build new conclusion from independent contributors - collective, e.g. financial market influenced by a coordinated effort
  - Why predication works? nonrandom data contains patterns that can be generalize by algorithm
  - Limits? ML methods can only generalize based on the data that has been seen; possibility of overgeneralizing

# Making Recommendations - Collaborative filtering algorithm
  - Find similarity scores
  - Produce weighted scores

# Discovering Groups - Data Clustering
  - Supervised vs unsupervised learning
  - Capture the distribution in space
  - Hierarchical clustering - continuously merging the two most similar/near groups
    - Disadvantage: Tree view does not break the data into groups; Computationally intensive;
  - K-means clustering

# Searching and Ranking
  - Full-text search engine: a list of words as input and ranked documents based on the relevance
  - Crawler ==> Word Separator/Stemmer ==> Indexing ==> Ranking (word frequency; location in a doc, e.g. topic; word distance; reference count)
