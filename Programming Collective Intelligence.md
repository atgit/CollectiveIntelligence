# Intro
  - Use machine learning and statistical methods to interpret data
  - Build new conclusion from independent contributors - collective, e.g. financial market influenced by a coordinated effort
  - Why predications works? nonrandom data contains patterns that can be generalize by algorithm
  - Limits? ML methods can only generalize based on the data that has been seen; possiblity of overgeneralizing

# Making Recommendations - Collaborative filtering algorithm
  - Find similarity scores
  - Produce weighted scores

# Discovering Groups - Data Clustering
  - Supervised vs unsupervised learning
